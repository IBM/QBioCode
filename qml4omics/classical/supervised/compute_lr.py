    arguments specified in the config.yaml file, but will use the default parameters specified above if none are passed. 
    The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the test dataset. The function returns the evaluation of the model 
    on the test dataset, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken to train and validate the model.
    This function is designed to be used in a supervised learning context, where the goal is to classify data points.

    Args:
        X_train (numpy.ndarray): Training data features.
        X_test (numpy.ndarray): Test data features.
        y_train (numpy.ndarray): Training data labels.
        y_test (numpy.ndarray): Test data labels.
        args (dict): Additional arguments, such as dataset name and other configurations.
        model (str): Name of the model being used, default is 'Logistic Regression'.
        data_key (str): Key for the dataset, default is an empty string.
        penalty (str): Regularization penalty, default is 'l2'.

        C (float): Inverse of regularization strength, default is 1.0.
        fit_intercept (bool): Whether to fit the intercept, default is True.
        intercept_scaling (float): Scaling factor for the intercept, default is 1.
        class_weight (dict or None): Weights associated with classes, default is None.
        random_state (int or None): Random seed for reproducibility, default is None.
        solver (str): Algorithm to use in the optimization problem, default is 'saga'.
        max_iter (int): Maximum number of iterations for convergence, default is 10000.
        multi_class (str): Multi-class option, deprecated in this context.
        verbose (bool): Whether to print detailed logs, default is False.
        warm_start (bool): Whether to reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization,
                           default is False.
        n_jobs (int or None): Number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`, 
                              default is None which means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context.
        l1_ratio (float or None): The Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1. 
                                  Only used if penalty='elasticnet', default is None.
