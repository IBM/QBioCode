    "We obtained 545 breast cancer samples from TCGA for which both RNAseq and Methylation450 data were available. The dataset consisted of 414 Luminal-A and 141 Luminal-B samples. We considered 28,495 genes and 363,791 methylation sites for a total of 392,286 features. We concatenated the RNAseq and Methylation450 data and projected them to a 10-dimensional space using PCA.  "
