This folder contains template SLURM scripts that could be used if you are running qsage on an HPC cluster.
These scripts are not necessary if you are running this on a single node or your own machine. 
Depending on your HPC's version of SLURM, some modifications may need to be made to these scripts, but this serves as a general template.


To run any of these scripts, type following on the command line:

sbatch slurm_script_name.sh

To check status of jobs:

squeue

To can cancel a particular job:

scancel job_id
